# RootSpace

User-owned knowledge space — one source, your control, zero fragmentation.

## Specs

Consult `specs/` before implementing features or making changes:

- `specs/user/` — user-facing specifications (MCP protocol, auth, storage)
- `specs/dev/` — internal rules (commits, licensing, deployment, auth implementation)
- `specs/iterations/` — iteration plans with task breakdowns
- `specs/tests/` — test specifications with acceptance criteria

If code changes affect what specs describe, update the relevant spec file accordingly.

## Architecture Decisions

ADRs are stored in `docs/decisions/`. Use adr-tools conventions.
